<!-- Build a simple form that has an <input> where a user can fill in their favorite band, like mechlo and it will return a handful of songs by them or with their name in it.

When the user types in a band name and presses the submit button, you should then make the search request. You can trap this with the onSubmit() event.

Once you have the data, you should fetch the specific data and use the results to display a listing of songs related to the search term.

Then to add some features, you should set it up so when a user clicks on one of the songs, it should then play in an <audio> tag that you've also added to the page. -->
